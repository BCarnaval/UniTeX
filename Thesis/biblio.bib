	abstract = {The one-dimensional case of free electrons interacting with lattice displacements is solved by a self-consistent method. It is found that for a certain range of the interaction parametera single sinusoidal lattice displacement is strongly excited in the lowest level of the system. Its wave-length is such as to create an energy gap in the single-electron energy spectrum with all states below it filled, and all above it empty. This periodic lattice displacement plays the role of an ‘inner field’ and leads to periodic fluctuation in the electronic density in such a way that the two stabilize each other. In an infinite medium described by a periodic boundary condition they are not fixed absolutely in space, but only relative to each other. Excitation of electrons across the gap leads to a decrease in both the electronic density fluctuations and the width of the gap. The whole system, electrons plus lattice displacements, can move through the lattice without being disturbed provided the velocity
              v
              is sufficiently small. The inertia of this system is equal to that of all electrons augmented by a term due to the lattice displacements. Elastic scattering of individual electrons which normally leads to the residual resistance is impossible if
              v
              is sufficiently small. The linear specific heat of normal electrons is eliminated and replaced by an exponential term.},

The presentation consists of three parts: First, the introduction of fundamental notions of probabilities, moments, cumulants, and their relation by the linked cluster theorem, of which Wick's theorem is the most important special case; followed by the diagrammatic formulation of perturbation theory, reviewed in the statistical setting. Second, dynamics described by stochastic differential equations in the Ito-formulation, treated in the Martin-Siggia-Rose-De Dominicis-Janssen path integral formalism. With concepts from disordered systems, we then study networks with random connectivity and derive their self-consistent dynamic mean-field theory, explaining the statistics of fluctuations and the emergence of different phases with regular and chaotic dynamics. Third, we introduce the effective action, vertex functions, and the loopwise expansion. These tools are illustrated by systematic derivations of self-consistency equations, going beyond the mean-field approximation. These methods are applied to the pairwise maximum entropy (Ising spin) model, including the recently-found diagrammatic derivation of the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer mean field theory.},

Special emphasis is placed on the application of scaling theory to quasi-one-dimensional systems at non zero temperature. We begin by introducing the scaling ansatz for purely one-dimensional fermion systems and its extension when interchain coupling and dimensionality crossovers are present at ﬁnite temperature. Next, we review the application of the renormalization group technique to the one-dimensional electron gas model and clarify some peculiarities of the method at the twoloop level. The inﬂuence of interchain coupling is then included and results for the crossover phenomenology and the multiplicity of characteristic energy scales are summarized. The emergence of the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism in quasi-one-dimensional electronic structures is discussed for both superconducting and density-wave channels.},

The instabilities and possible ground states are studied by investigating the behaviour of the response functions. The relationship between this model and others is discussed and is used to obtain further inibrmation about the behaviour of the system. The model is generalized to a set of coupled chains to describe quasi-one-dimensional systems.

	abstract = {The results of an electron spin resonance (ESR) study of trans-polyacetylene, before and after doping with AsF5, are reported. The undoped polymer exhibits a Lorentzian line (g=2.00263) indicative of motional narrowing from a mobile unpaired electron species. Measurement of the intensity indicates a Curie law susceptibility with approximately one unpaired electron per 3×103 carbon atoms in agreement with earlier studies. From these results and comparison with earlier data on the cis polymer, it is suggested that the ESR signal arises from a mobile defect in the π system. Utilizing an apparatus which allows in situ AsF5 doping of a polyacetylene sample in the microwave cavity, we have monitored the ESR signal during the doping process. The spin resonance line narrows and increases in intensity, with no detectable g shift, as the doping proceeds. At high doping levels the line becomes asymmetric with a characteristic Dysonian line shape consistent with metallic behavior.},
